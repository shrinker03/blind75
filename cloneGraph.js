üîç Problem Summary:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node has a val and a list of neighbors.

üí° Approach:

Use DFS to traverse and clone nodes.

Use a Map to track already cloned nodes (to avoid cycles and re-cloning).

Base case: return null if input node is null.

For each neighbor, recursively clone and push into the clone‚Äôs neighbors.

üß© Time Complexity: O(N)
üì¶ Space Complexity: O(N)
Where N is the number of nodes in the graph.
