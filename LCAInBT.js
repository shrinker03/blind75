ðŸ§  Flash Card: Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST
Problem:
Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes p and q in a Binary Search Tree.

Approach:

Use BST property:

If both p and q are greater than current â†’ move right

If both are less â†’ move left

Else â†’ current node is the LCA

Why it works:

The first node where p and q split in direction is their lowest common ancestor.

Time Complexity: O(h)
Space Complexity: O(1) (Iterative version)

ðŸŒ² Works only for BSTs, not generic binary trees.
